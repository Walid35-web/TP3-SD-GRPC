# Distributed Systems with GRPC
## Goal: 
#### - create a client-server application based on GRPC which exposes a service which makes it possible to consultbank accounts
#### - Create a GRPC chat server:
  1. Test the Chat server with a GRPC client like BloomRPC 
  2. Java GRPC Client 
  3. Python GRPC Client 
 
#### - GAME Server: At startup, the server chooses a random number between 1 and 1000. The GRPC clients must then guess the secret number in competition and the server answers each time with the following possibilities
  1. Your's is higher or smaller
  2. Good job you won and  send the winner to the customers
  3. The game is over and the winner is the "winner's number".
